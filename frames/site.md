# Sparational 4 - make faster websites faster, faster. 
Make speedier websites that can be updated more quickly, in a way that allows you to make a lot more of them in the same time. Sparational version 4 is so easy to use that instead of using it, you make websites faster. 
Start with a site frame or write your own. Add a Markdown sitelet to your site. Or go crazy and build a full-blown back-end server to host and feed the API? Maybe just start with a sitelet and go from there.
Compose beautiful websites entirely from Markdown and CSS. You'll never need to write HTML or Javascript again.
